    <p>
      CWD is an <b>execution environment</b> for blockchains. What do we mean by this?
    </p>
    <p>
      A blockchain is made up of two parts: consensus and execution. The lifecycle of a block is an
      interplay between them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the consensus layer makes a block;
      </li>
      <li>
        the block is passed to the execution layer, which executes the transactions;
      </li>
      <li>
        the execution result is passed back to consensus, where nodes reach agreement over the result.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="blockchain.jpg">
    <p>
      CWD is an execution layer. It is agnostic to which consensus layer is used, meaning you can
      couple it with a layer-1 (L1) consensus engine such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938">Tendermint</a>,
      in which case you get an L1 chain, or with a layer-2 (L2) one, typically consisting of a
      sequencer and a prover, in which case you get an L2 chain.

      Execution
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      There are a few execution environments you can choose from when building your own blockchain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        various implementations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Arbitrum, OP Stack,
        Evmos, and <a href="https://github.com/berachain/polaris">Polaris</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Solana VM (SVM)
      </li>
      <li>
        the two dialects of Move, <a href="https://aptos.dev/move/move-on-aptos/">Aptos</a> and <a href="https://blog.sui.io/why-we-created-sui-move/">Sui</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://cosmwasm.com/">CosmWasm</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cosmos SDK
      </li>
      <li>
        Avalanche's <a href="https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk">HyperSDK</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Polkadot's <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk">Substrate</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk">Sovereign SDK</a> for rollups
      </li>
      <li>
        StarkNet
      </li>
      <li>
        Polygon's <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk">Chain Development Kit (CDK)</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        and CWD, of course
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CWD is <i>a modified version</i> of CosmWasm with numerous improvements, reimplemented in the
      Rust programming language (the original is in Go).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, why choose CWD over our competitors? Because it is (at least in our opinion) <b>performant</b>,
      <b>secure</b>, <b>feature rich</b>, and simply <b>a pleasure to use</b>: (<i>WARNING: nerd stuff below</i>)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> or Wasm as the
        sandbox for running smart contracts. Wasm is perhaps the most optimized virtual environment
        of all, and it's portable - you can run your contracts in a web browser for example, which
        massively simplifies webapp development in some cases.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CosmWasm is designed in a way that makes some most common security pitfalls, such as
        reentrancy, fundamentally impossible. As a modified version of CosmWasm, CWD inherits this
        benefit. See <a href="https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/architecture/smart-contracts">this page</a>
        to learn more.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD smart contracts can do things not possible in other execution environments. For example,
        <ul>
          <li>
            assigning actions to be executed at regular intervals without manual invokation
          </li>
          <li>
            custom transaction ordering
          </li>
        </ul>
        With competitor frameworks such as the EVM, these things require offchain bots (e.g. <a href="https://www.gelato.network/">Gelato</a>)
        or MEV relays (<a href="">Flashbots</a>), but with CWD you get them for free.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD transactions are natively multicall.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD has <a href="https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/">Cosmos IBC</a> enshrined as the native
        bridging protocol for cross-chain message passing with Ethereum and Cosmos chains.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD enshrines a unique token standard inspired by Solana's SPL and <a href="https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/tokenfactory">works by Osmosis</a>
        that removes ERC-20's approval mechanism (no more user confusion and hacks), allows for
        multi-send as well as ERC-677's transferAndCall, also making it significantly easier to
        index.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        CWD implements, or will implement in later versions, some of the newest ideas in the crypto
        space:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Native account abstraction.</b> In fact, there is no "externally owned accounts" or EOAs in
            CWD at all. Every account is a smart contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parallel processing (more research needed on this; Sei Network implemented this for
            CosmWasm, we can perhaps copy what they did)
          </li>
          <li>
            State rent and expiration (based on <a href="https://diem-developers-components.netlify.app/papers/the-diem-blockchain/2020-05-26.pdf">Diem litepaper</a>
            section 4.4)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the native Rust toolchain for testing, linting, and benchmarking. Import any Wasm-compatible
        Rust library into your contracts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="cosmwasm-vs-evm.jpg">
    <p>
      CWD is not the <i>fastest</i> execution environment. In fact, some of its designs are
      explicitly not the most efficient in terms of CPU time or memory usage, but with tradeoffs
      that we think are worth it, such as improved security or developer experience. <b>Our goal,
      instead, is to make CWD the best framework for 95% of the applications.</b> The rest 5% that
      require extreme optimizations can look for other solutions that tailor to their needs.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Consensus
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      CWD communicates with consensus engines via an interface called <a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/README.md">ABCI</a>.
      Theoretically any consensus engine that implements ABCI can be used along with CWD. These
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft">CometBFT</a>, an implementation of Tendermint
        consensus protocol in the Go programming language
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docs.union.build/architecture/cometbls">CometBLS</a>, a fork of CometBFT
        using a different cryptography that is more ZK-friendly
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit">Rollkit</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymint">Dymint</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We have not experimented with any ZK proof systems yet at this early stage, but there are a
      few options which we will try out:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0">RISC Zero</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/">Fluent</a> a.k.a. zkWASM
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Two things to note
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      We want to be completely honest to our customers (i.e. developers) on the
      drawbacks of using CWD. In our view, there are two:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>CWD is source available, but not open source.</b> It will be under a custom license that
        works like this:
        <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
          <li>
            if you want to deploy contracts on <i>an existing chain</i>, you can do it
            completely freely;
          </li>
          <li>
            to run nodes of <i>an existing chain</i>, or providing services for <i>an existing chain</i>
            (e.g. RPC service) you can do it completely freely;
          </li>
          <li>
            to launch <i>a new chain</i>, however, it is necessary to acquire a license from
            CWSoftware, the company that owns CWD.
          </li>
        </ul>
        CWSoftware may ask for a payment, typically in the form of a percentage of the project's
        tokens (subject to reasonable vesting terms).
        <div style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
          In my opinion, this is a good way for pricing, because 1) it poses no upfront cash cost
          for developers, and 2) it creates incentive alignment - to grow the value of its tokens,
          CWSoftware is incentivized to help developers succeed. For especially promising projects,
          we may even offer add-on services such as consulting and custom dev works as part of the
          licensing agreement.

      </li>

        <b>CWD is not backward compatible with existing CosmWasm smart contracts.</b>
